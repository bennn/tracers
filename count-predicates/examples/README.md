examples
========

Simple example programs to be traced.

- `factorial` function flows in one direction
- `even` functions flow in both directions
- `struct` check contract generation for all struct fields
- `opaque` check contract generation for opaque types
- `list` check if `list/c` contracts are counted, or only the contracts on list elements
- `snake` large example, the snakey game

Each folder contains a runnable `main.rkt` file.
This can be run alone, or using the tracing script.
